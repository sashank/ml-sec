### Compatibility Notes
‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Updates for Modern Python (3.14+):**

1. **PyFlux Replacement**: The original `pyflux` package is incompatible with Python 3.14+. The ARIMA forecasting examples (Chapter 3) have been updated to use a custom implementation with scikit-learn's LinearRegression and time series feature engineering.

2. **TensorFlow/Keras Replacement**: TensorFlow and Keras are not yet compatible with Python 3.14+. The LSTM anomaly detection examples (Chapter 3) have been updated to use scikit-learn's MLPRegressor as an alternative neural network implementation.

3. **Pandas API Changes**: Removed deprecated `infer_datetime_format` parameter from CSV reading operations and replaced deprecated `as_matrix()` with `values` property.

4. **Package Versions**: All packages have been updated to their latest stable versions for better performance and security.

5. **Installation**: Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install compatible versions, or install individual packages using the latest versions listed above.
