    "- Naive Bayes is one of the most effective methods for text classification\n",
    "- Assumes feature independence (naive assumption) but works well in practice\n",

    "- Fast training and prediction, suitable for large datasets\n",

    "**Dataset Setup:**\n",
    "1. Download the Ling-Spam dataset from Kaggle \n",
    "2. Place the CSV file in the 'datasets/' directory\n",

    "## Summary and Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "The Naive Bayes classifier demonstrates excellent performance for email spam detection:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Findings:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **High Accuracy**: The model achieves strong classification performance on the Ling-Spam dataset\n",
    "2. **Interpretable Features**: We can easily identify which words/phrases contribute most to spam/ham classification\n",
    "3. **Fast Training**: Naive Bayes trains quickly and requires minimal computational resources\n",
    "4. **Probabilistic Output**: The classifier provides confidence scores for predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of Naive Bayes for Spam Detection:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simple and Fast**: Easy to implement and train\n",
    "- **Handles Text Well**: Natural fit for bag-of-words text classification\n",
    "- **Feature Independence**: Works well even when word independence assumption is violated\n",
    "- **Probabilistic**: Provides meaningful confidence scores\n",
    "- **Small Dataset Friendly**: Performs well with limited training data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feature Independence Assumption**: Assumes words are independent (not always true)\n",
    "- **Zero Frequency Problem**: Smoothing (alpha parameter) needed for unseen words\n",
    "- **Context Ignorance**: Doesn't consider word order or context\n",
    "\n",
    "### Security Applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach can be extended to:\n",
    "- Email spam filtering systems\n",
    "- Malicious URL detection\n",
    "- Phishing email identification\n",
    "- Content-based security filtering\n",
    "- Social media spam detection\n",
    "\n",
    "The combination of high accuracy, interpretability, and speed makes Naive Bayes an excellent baseline for text-based security applications."
